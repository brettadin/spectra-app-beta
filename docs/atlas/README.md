## Atlas ##

This directory hosts many documentations relevent to the project being worked on by the human developer.
They have provided extensive documention for you to read through so all logic and thought processes have a sound basis.
These files will be subject to change, and may contain inaccuracies.
You will add, adjust, tweak, revise, improve, and create Atlas entries as you work.
You will reference each atlas entry in files where applicable.
You will expand upon the atlas documentations, and revise them such they remain accurate as we work. 
If you spot issues, inaccuracies, or any other items which need clarification make note of it in the file the issue is in (flag it in some way), and add a workload_backlog.md entry (see docs\reviews) to address the issue, using the flag as a quick way to reference it.

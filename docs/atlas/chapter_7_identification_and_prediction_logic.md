# Chapter 7 ‚Äî Identification and Prediction Logic

> **Purpose.** Specify a transparent, testable identification and prediction engine that ingests calibrated spectra from multiple modalities (atomic emission/absorption, FTIR/ATR, Raman, UV‚ÄìVis, fluorescence, and optional non‚Äëoptical validators), generates candidate hypotheses, scores them with explainable metrics, fuses evidence under explicit priors, and produces auditable reports.
>
> **Scope.** Campus instruments and curated external libraries; detection, classification, and regression tasks (e.g., functional‚Äëgroup tagging, bandgap estimation). Supports astrophysical use cases (radial velocity, template matching) and lab samples (solutions, solids, gas cells).
>
> **Path notice.** File and folder names are **placeholders**. All paths must be resolved via the application‚Äôs path resolver at runtime. Tokens like `[SESSION_ID]`, `[DATASET_ID]`, `[MODALITY]`, `[YYYYMMDD]` are variables; do not hardcode.

## 1. Design principles

1. **Deterministic by default.** Given the same inputs and configuration, results are bit‚Äëwise reproducible. Randomized routines fix `seed` and record it.
2. **Explainable first.** Every score decomposes into per‚Äëfeature, per‚Äëmodality contributions with uncertainties.
3. **Raw preserved.** Only views are transformed; raw data remain immutable (see Chapter 6).
4. **Priors explicit.** Elemental presence, stoichiometry, environment, and source reliability feed into priors that are visible and editable.
5. **Graceful missingness.** Absent modalities re‚Äëweight the fusion but never silently zero out evidence.

---

## 2. Inputs and context

- **Spectrum bundles** from Chapter 6 with: calibrated axis, response‚Äëcorrected intensity, LSF/Resolution, uncertainties.
- **Extracted features** (peaks/bands/edges) with centers, FWHM, intensities, and covariance (see Chapter 3 schema).
- **Priors**: elemental detections (atomic), plausible stoichiometries, temperature/pressure, solvent/matrix, trust tiers for libraries (Chapter 4).
- **Templates**: line lists and spectral templates (atomic, molecular, minerals, astro) with versioned provenance.

---

## 3. Candidate generation

1. **Atomic‚Äëgated shortlist**: map detected elements to allowed molecular families (e.g., presence of Na and CO‚ÇÉ¬≤‚Åª hints alkali carbonates) using a simple ruleset table.
2. **Band dictionary hit**: rough matching of diagnostic IR/Raman regions to candidate groups/isomers.
3. **Context filters**: temperature/pressure windows, solvent presence, expected phase (solid/gas/solution), astrophysical class.
4. **User constraints** (optional): whitelist/blacklist, known sample prep.

The candidate set `ùìí` proceeds to modality‚Äëlevel scoring.

---

## 4. Per‚Äëmodality scoring

Let observed features be \(\{x_j\}\) and template/library expectations for candidate \(M\) be \(\{\mu_i\}\) with uncertainties.

### 4.1 Sparse features (lines/bands)

- **Position likelihood (Gaussian)**
\[
\mathcal{L}_i = \exp\!\left[-\tfrac{1}{2}\Big(\tfrac{x_j-\mu_i}{\sigma_i}\Big)^2\right], \quad \sigma_i^2 = \sigma_{\text{inst}}^2 + \sigma_{\text{lib}}^2
\]
- **Intensity consistency (optional)** using a robust loss comparing observed vs expected relative intensities; down‚Äëweight when absolute calibration is unavailable.
- **Penalty terms** for extra peaks not explained by \(M\) (FP) and expected peaks missing (FN), scaled by diagnostic weights \(w_i\).

**Per‚Äëmodality score**
\[
S_k(M) = \sum_{i\in k} w_i \log \mathcal{L}_i \; - \; \alpha_k\,\mathrm{FP}_k \; - \; \beta_k\,\mathrm{FN}_k
\]

### 4.2 Dense templates (cross‚Äëcorrelation)

For continua or dense bands (astro molecules, mineral lattices), compute normalized cross‚Äëcorrelation with the template convolved to the instrument LSF and adjusted for shift/broadening parameters \((\Delta,\gamma)\):
\[
C_k(M)=\max_{\Delta,\gamma}\; \frac{\langle \tilde{T}_M(\Delta,\gamma),\; D_k\rangle}{\|\tilde{T}_M(\Delta,\gamma)\|\,\|D_k\|}
\]
Convert \(C_k\) to a log‚Äëlikelihood via Fisher transform or empirically calibrated mapping.

### 4.3 Raman specifics

- Use **exact Œª‚ÇÄ** for Raman shift (Chapter 5). Propagate \(\sigma_{\Delta\tilde{\nu}}\) from Œª‚ÇÄ and Œª‚Çõ uncertainties.
- Apply fluorescence baseline correction masks; record baseline model in the evidence object.

### 4.4 UV‚ÄìVis specifics

- For quant work, score linearity of Beer‚ÄìLambert calibration for target species. For solids/films, derive bandgap (Tauc) and compare to candidate ranges.

### 4.5 Fluorescence specifics

- Score Stokes shift, emission maxima, and quenching behavior against candidate fluorophores or microenvironments.

---

## 5. Priors and reliability weights

- **Elemental prior** \(P_0(M)\): compatible with detected elements and plausible stoichiometries.
- **Environment prior**: temperature/pressure/solvent constraints.
- **Source reliability weights** \(\rho_s\): trust tier of libraries (Chapter 4) and measurement quality (SNR, calibration RMS). These scale \(w_i\) and the per‚Äëmodality \(\lambda_k\).

Priors are explicit objects in the manifest, each with rationale and provenance.

---

## 6. Evidence fusion

Combine per‚Äëmodality scores with weights \(\lambda_k\) to produce a log‚Äëposterior (up to a constant):
\[
\log P(M\mid \mathbf{D}) = \log P_0(M) + \sum_k \lambda_k\, S_k(M) - \Gamma(M)
\]
where \(\Gamma(M)\) includes complexity penalties (e.g., for adding too many components) and rule‚Äëbased penalties (e.g., environmental contradictions).

**Confidence tiers**
- **High**: posterior gap to alternative \(\Delta\ge\tau_H\) and minimum evidence in ‚â•2 modalities.
- **Moderate**: \(\tau_M \le \Delta < \tau_H\) or strong single‚Äëmodality evidence with no contradictions.
- **Low/Provisional**: otherwise; report additional data likely to disambiguate.

Thresholds \(\tau_H, \tau_M\) are set via validation (see ¬ß10) and recorded with versioning.

## 7. Machine‚Äëlearning assists (optional but encouraged)

### 7.1 Tasks
- **IR/Raman functional‚Äëgroup tagging** (multi‚Äëlabel classification).
- **Bandgap estimation** from UV‚ÄìVis (regression).
- **Anomaly discovery** for unknowns (unsupervised/one‚Äëclass methods).
- **Astro template selection** and spectral type suggestion.

### 7.2 Training data hygiene
- Curate labels from authoritative sources; split by **sample** not by scan to avoid leakage.
- Use cross‚Äëvalidation with stratification by class and instrument.
- Calibrate probabilities (Platt or isotonic). Track calibration error.

### 7.3 Model choices
- Start with transparent models (logistic/gradient boosting) for tagging; add 1D CNNs only when justified.
- Always ship **feature importance/SHAP** for explainability. Store model hash, training set ID, and metrics.

### 7.4 Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop
- User corrections update a **feedback log**; periodically retrain with review. Keep an audit trail of label provenance.

---

## 8. Conflict handling and follow‚Äëup design

- Generate a **conflict report** when modalities disagree beyond tolerance: list discordant features, suspected causes (resolution mismatch, baseline, fluorescence, matrix), and recommended follow‚Äëups (e.g., higher‚Äëresolution IR, low‚Äëfreq Raman, different solvent).
- Provide an **active‚Äëinference** suggestion: the single next measurement with the highest expected information gain.

## 10. Validation and benchmarking

1. **Gold standards:** measure a panel of known samples across modalities; freeze as the **benchmark set** with checksums.
2. **Metrics:** identification accuracy, top‚Äëk accuracy, calibration curves (reliability), detection precision/recall, ROC/PR for binary tags.
3. **Weight tuning:** optimize \(\lambda_k\) and penalty parameters via cross‚Äëvalidation on the benchmark set.
4. **Stress tests:** simulate resolution mismatches, baseline drifts, and SNR drops; ensure graceful degradation.
5. **Astro checks:** verify radial velocity, template matches, and telluric handling on standard stars.

All benchmark results are exported to a `benchmarks/` folder with versioned reports.

---

## 11. Edge cases and mitigations

- **Isomer ambiguity:** escalate to low‚Äëfrequency Raman or NMR prior when bands coincide.
- **Baseline/fluorescence contamination:** increase penalties on intensity terms; rely more on position likelihoods.
- **Overlapping species mixtures:** allow multi‚Äëcomponent hypotheses with L1 penalty to discourage over‚Äëfitting.
- **Resolution mismatch:** re‚Äëcompute comparisons at the coarsest FWHM; reject if post‚Äëconvolution mismatch persists.
- **Astro tellurics/continuum:** mask telluric regions; use standard‚Äëstar derived response/continuum models.

---

## 12. API surface (pseudocode)

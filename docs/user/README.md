## user docs
This directory is for items which are displayed in the user documentation portion of the UI.
This should host a suite of individual documents for the user to access and reference inside the program.
The information should be relevent to all subjects and fields explored within the program and categorized by topic, subtopic, etc.
All math, definitions, topics, fields, learning material, will all be displayed in clear, correct, and detailed forms. 
*Note: The AI agents should also refer to this material such that they can understand the functionality of our program*
Utilize several documents each with dedicated information relevent to the topic at hand.
These documents should also be displayed correctly in the program itself, and should be grouped and labeled and easily referenced/searched for. 
Include links to other documents, formulas, definitions, etc in the documentation such that they can be easily accessed.

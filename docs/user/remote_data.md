# Remote data catalogue workflow

The **Remote Data** dialog lets you browse curated catalogues without leaving the
desktop preview. Searches are routed through provider-specific adapters and the
downloads are cached in your local Spectra data directory so you can re-open
them even when offline.

## Opening the dialog

1. Choose **File → Fetch Remote Data…** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+R`).
2. Pick a catalogue from the *Catalogue* selector. The initial release ships
   with:
   - **NIST ASD** (line lists via the Atomic Spectra Database)
   - **MAST** (MAST data products via `astroquery.mast`)
3. Enter a keyword, element symbol, or target name in the search field and click
   **Search**.

The results table displays identifiers, titles, and the source URI for each
match. Selecting a row shows the raw metadata payload in the preview panel so
you can confirm provenance before downloading.

## Downloading and importing spectra

1. Select one or more rows in the results table.
2. Click **Download & Import** to fetch the source files and pipe them through
   the normal ingestion pipeline.

Behind the scenes the application:

* Streams the remote file through the HTTP/MAST client and writes it to a
  temporary location.
* Copies the artefact into the `LocalStore`, recording the provider, URI,
  checksum, and fetch timestamp in the cache index.
* Hands the stored path to `DataIngestService` so the file benefits from the
  existing importer registry, unit normalisation, and provenance hooks.

Imported spectra appear in the dataset tree immediately. They behave exactly
like manual imports: overlays update, the data table refreshes, and the history
dock records a "Remote Import" entry with the provider URI and cache checksum.

## Offline behaviour and caching

Every download is associated with its remote URI. If you request the same file
again the dialog reuses the cached copy instead of issuing another network
request. This makes it safe to build collections during limited connectivity:
the cache stores the raw download alongside canonical units so future sessions
can ingest the files instantly.

If persistent caching is disabled in **File → Enable Persistent Cache**, remote
fetches are stored in a temporary data directory for the current session. The
dialog will still reuse results within that session, but the artefacts are
discarded once the preview shell closes.

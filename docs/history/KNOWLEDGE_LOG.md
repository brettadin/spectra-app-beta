# Consolidated Knowledge Log

This file serves as the single entry point for all historical notes, patches,
"brains" and "atlas" logs.  Previous iterations of Spectra‑App stored
information in many places (e.g. `brains`, `atlas`, `PATCHLOG.txt`) and often
used confusing naming schemes (sometimes based on the day of the month)【875267955107972†L63-L74】.
To avoid further fragmentation, every meaningful change or insight should be
recorded here with a timestamp and a clear description.

## Log Format

Each entry in this document should follow this structure:

```markdown
## YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM – [Component]

**Author**: human or agent name

**Context**: Short description of what part of the system this log refers to
  (e.g. Unit conversion, UI logic, Importer plugin).

**Summary**: Concise explanation of what was done, why it was necessary, and
  any immediate outcomes or open questions.

**References**: Links to relevant files, commits or external sources (use
  citation markers like 【875267955107972†L29-L41】 for primary documentation where
  applicable).

---
```

Entries should be appended chronologically.  Older logs imported from the
original repository can be summarised and linked at the end of this file.
When summarising legacy content, include a note indicating that the details
come from a previous format (e.g. “Imported from brains/2023‑04‑10.md”).

### Automation support

The desktop preview now ships with a `KnowledgeLogService` that writes
automation events into this file by default.  The service can also be pointed
at an alternative runtime location (e.g. a temporary path during tests) by
passing a custom `log_path`, ensuring automated provenance never tramples the
canonical history while still following the structure defined here.

## Example Entry

```markdown
## 2025‑10‑14 15:23 – Units Service

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Implementation of the new UnitsService for the PySide6 rewrite.

**Summary**: Added support for converting wavelength between nm, μm and
  wavenumber, as well as intensity between absorbance and transmittance.  The
  service ensures idempotent conversions and records conversion metadata.
  Tested round‑trip conversions manually.【328409478188748†L22-L59】

**References**: `app/services/units_service.py`, design spec in
  `specs/units_and_conversions.md`, and original conversion formulas from
  `server/ir_units.py` in the legacy code【328409478188748†L22-L59】.

```

## Migration of Legacy Logs

To migrate existing `brains` and `atlas` logs, follow these steps:

1. Identify all existing log files in the old repository.  Normalize their
   names to the `YYYY‑MM‑DD_description.md` format.  If a file name refers
   to the day of the month rather than the actual date, determine the
   correct date by examining commit history or file metadata【875267955107972†L63-L74】.
2. Summarise the content of each file into a single entry in this log.  Use
   bullet points to capture key decisions, problems solved, and lessons
   learned.  Reference the original file location for traceability.
3. After migration, store the original files in an archive folder so that
   nothing is lost.

## Policy

* **Honesty**: Be transparent about decisions and mistakes.  If an entry
  describes an incorrect approach, annotate the outcome and how it was
  resolved.
* **Completeness**: Include enough information for future developers or
  agents to understand the context without having to search through commit
  history.  When in doubt, write more rather than less.
* **Citation**: Use tether IDs to cite official documents, academic papers or
  authoritative resources.  This ensures that claims can be verified.

## 2025-10-14 20:00 – Documentation

**Author**: agent

**Context**: User-facing onboarding documentation and planning artifacts.

**Summary**: Authored the first-run quickstart (`docs/user/quickstart.md`) so new operators can launch the desktop build, ingest bundled spectra, validate unit toggles, and export a provenance bundle without guesswork. Updated the README quick start section to highlight the guide and extended the Batch 3 workplan to track remaining documentation gaps aligned with the inventory. Captured the work in patch notes for traceability.

**References**: `docs/user/quickstart.md`, `README.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`, `docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md`.
## 2025-10-15 00:17 – Provenance Exports

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Provenance bundle hardening and documentation alignment.

**Summary**: Expanded export bundles to emit per-spectrum CSVs, copy source uploads, and write a structured activity log so downstream reviewers can trace every spectrum back to its canonical and raw forms.【F:app/services/provenance_service.py†L50-L108】 Regression coverage now confirms the manifest, CSVs, PNG snapshot, and log travel together and that canonical/exported paths are reflected inside the manifest for auditing.【F:tests/test_provenance_manifest.py†L24-L74】 Updated the importing guide’s provenance appendix so operators know what to expect in the bundle until the roadmap/workplan refresh lands, at which point I’ll backfill a direct planning link here.【F:docs/user/importing.md†L92-L111】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L81-L85】

**References**: `app/services/provenance_service.py`, `tests/test_provenance_manifest.py`, `docs/user/importing.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

## 2025-10-15 00:37 – Importer Heuristics & In-App Docs

**Author**: agent

**Context**: CSV/TXT heuristic upgrades and embedded documentation viewer.

**Summary**: Reworked the CSV importer to cache header layouts, scan messy tables for the dominant numeric block, and score candidate axes so we can recover wavelength/intensity pairs even when prose, Unicode units, or intensity-first exports get in the way.【F:app/services/importers/csv_importer.py†L93-L200】 Regression tests now cover preface-based unit detection, noisy-column scoring, cache invalidation, and axis corrections to keep heuristics honest.【F:tests/test_csv_importer.py†L11-L160】 Wired a Docs tab into the Inspector (and exposed it via Help → View Documentation) so all user guides render in-app for quick reference; I’ll link the refreshed roadmap/workplan doc when it’s published to capture this dependency there.【F:app/main.py†L1795-L1849】【F:docs/user/in_app_documentation.md†L1-L34】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L87-L99】

## 2025-10-15 01:04 – Normalization Pipeline & Axis Heuristics

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Overlay normalization plumbing and importer profile-based swaps.

**Summary**: Routed overlay rendering through a normalization helper so Max and Area modes scale reference spectra deterministically while keeping raw arrays intact for provenance.【F:app/services/overlay_service.py†L36-L92】 Added a profile-based swap to the CSV importer so monotonic intensity channels no longer masquerade as the independent axis, ensuring the plot toolbar’s normalization toggle manipulates the correct series.【F:app/services/importers/csv_importer.py†L174-L200】 Regression coverage now verifies both normalization paths and importer decisions, and the importing guide documents how raw units stay untouched until operators opt in to scaling; I’ll update this note with a roadmap/workplan link once that artifact is refreshed.【F:tests/test_overlay_service.py†L6-L41】【F:docs/user/importing.md†L34-L90】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L100-L110】

**References**: `app/services/overlay_service.py`, `app/services/importers/csv_importer.py`, `tests/test_overlay_service.py`, `docs/user/importing.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

## 2025-10-15 01:27 – Importer Header Safeguards

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Header-driven unit enforcement and conflict resolution.

**Summary**: Tightened the CSV importer so unit-only headers are trusted, conflicting axis labels trigger a swap with recorded rationale, and layout cache hits are ignored when validation fails, preventing subtle regressions on repeated ingest sessions.【F:app/services/importers/csv_importer.py†L176-L200】 Added regression tests to lock in the swap rationale, unit-only header handling, and cache miss flow, with documentation updates queued in the workplan backlog for follow-up linking once refreshed.【F:tests/test_csv_importer.py†L92-L184】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L111-L123】

**References**: `app/services/importers/csv_importer.py`, `tests/test_csv_importer.py`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

---

## 2025-10-15 03:24 – Reference Library & JWST Quick-Look Data

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Bundled reference datasets and inspector surfacing.

**Summary**: Staged hydrogen line lists, IR functional groups, line-shape placeholders, and digitised JWST spectra in the ReferenceLibrary so offline users can browse curated datasets with provenance metadata intact.【F:app/services/reference_library.py†L11-L126】 Regression coverage now asserts the catalogues include expected IDs, generators, and JWST quick-look metadata, while the reference guide narrates how overlays behave and calls out the planned swap to calibrated JWST pipelines—will backfill the roadmap/workplan link referencing that migration as soon as it lands.【F:tests/test_reference_library.py†L5-L45】【F:docs/user/reference_data.md†L1-L85】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L150-L155】

**References**: `app/services/reference_library.py`, `tests/test_reference_library.py`, `docs/user/reference_data.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

## 2025-10-16 23:10 – Remote Data Ingestion

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Remote catalogue search, caching, and UI integration.

**Summary**: Introduced a `RemoteDataService` that wraps NIST ASD and MAST lookups with dependency guards so optional `requests`/`astroquery` imports fail gracefully while cached downloads record provider URIs, checksums, and fetch timestamps in `LocalStore`.【F:app/services/remote_data_service.py†L1-L231】 Added a **File → Fetch Remote Data…** dialog that previews metadata, streams downloads through the standard ingest pipeline, and emits history entries for each remote import while logging the session status bar and knowledge log.【F:app/ui/remote_data_dialog.py†L1-L129】【F:app/main.py†L66-L896】 Documented the workflow, highlighted that remote imports behave like local overlays, updated patch notes, and wrote regression tests that mock remote APIs to assert URL construction, cache reuse, and provenance payloads.【F:docs/user/remote_data.md†L1-L52】【F:docs/user/plot_tools.md†L33-L37】【F:docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md†L1-L9】【F:tests/test_remote_data_service.py†L1-L120】

**References**: `app/services/remote_data_service.py`, `app/ui/remote_data_dialog.py`, `app/main.py`, `tests/test_remote_data_service.py`, `docs/user/remote_data.md`, `docs/user/plot_tools.md`, `docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md`.

## 2025-10-15 04:18 – Reference Regeneration Tooling

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Build scripts and provenance scaffolding for reference assets.

**Summary**: Added reproducible build scripts for hydrogen, IR bands, and JWST quick-look spectra so future refreshes capture generator metadata, retrieval timestamps, and pipeline settings inside each JSON asset.【F:tools/reference_build/build_jwst_quicklook.py†L1-L100】【F:docs/dev/reference_build.md†L1-L82】 Updated the reference guide to surface provenance fields in the inspector, noting the pending JWST pipeline replacement that we’ll link to the roadmap/workplan entry once updated.【F:docs/user/reference_data.md†L20-L63】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L139-L148】

**References**: `tools/reference_build/build_jwst_quicklook.py`, `docs/dev/reference_build.md`, `docs/user/reference_data.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

## 2025-10-15 07:05 – Reference Plotting & Multi-Import Workflow

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Inspector plot integration and batch ingest UX.

**Summary**: Ensured the Reference tab renders hydrogen bars, IR bands, and JWST curves inside an embedded plot while enabling File → Open to select multiple spectra in one pass; overlay toggles now mirror the active dataset without desynchronising the preview.【F:app/main.py†L900-L1040】 The smoke workflow regression covers the end-to-end path—instantiating the docs tab, plotting reference datasets, toggling overlays, and exporting manifests—which we’ll tie back to refreshed planning docs when available.【F:tests/test_smoke_workflow.py†L30-L142】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L155-L160】

**References**: `app/main.py`, `tests/test_smoke_workflow.py`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

---

## 2025-10-15 07:18 – Reference Overlay Fixes

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Overlay toggle persistence and documentation updates.

**Summary**: Patched the Reference inspector so combo-box selections stick, JWST datasets draw their sampled spectra, and overlay toggles follow the active dataset rather than the first entry, keeping the main plot and preview in sync.【F:app/main.py†L953-L1074】 Updated the reference guide to explain the synchronized overlay workflow and queued doc screenshot refreshes in the workplan backlog—link to be backfilled post-update.【F:docs/user/reference_data.md†L64-L77】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L10-L14】

**References**: `app/main.py`, `docs/user/reference_data.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

---

## 2025-10-15 07:45 – Reference Plotting & Importer Profile Swap

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Session persistence for reference selection and importer safeguards.

**Summary**: Persisted reference combo selections across sessions so JWST targets and IR overlays stay active after restarts while bolstering the importer’s profile-based safeguards that prevent jittery axes from being overwritten by monotonic intensity exports.【F:app/main.py†L961-L1040】【F:app/services/importers/csv_importer.py†L193-L200】 Regression coverage keeps combo changes, overlay payload swaps, and importer rationale in check; roadmap/workplan link will be backfilled once refreshed.【F:tests/test_smoke_workflow.py†L72-L96】【F:tests/test_csv_importer.py†L66-L133】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L24-L32】

**References**: `app/main.py`, `app/services/importers/csv_importer.py`, `tests/test_smoke_workflow.py`, `tests/test_csv_importer.py`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

## 2025-10-16 21:45 – Knowledge Log Automation

**Author**: agent

**Context**: KnowledgeLogService instrumentation and in-app history browser.

**Summary**: Built a reusable KnowledgeLogService that appends structured, provenance-ready events to the consolidated log (or a redirected runtime file), added filters/export helpers, and instrumented imports, overlays, exports, and math operations so SpectraMainWindow records session activity automatically. Surfaced the new History dock with search/filter controls and backed the flow with unit plus integration coverage.

## 2025-10-15 08:18 – Raw Intensity Defaults & Overlay Label Stacking

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Plot unit defaults and IR overlay readability.

**Summary**: Restored plot traces to display their source intensity units by default so `%T`, absorbance, and transmittance series remain untouched until operators choose normalization, with the plot pane wiring conversions accordingly.【F:app/ui/plot_pane.py†L258-L303】 Tightened overlay application so IR bands reuse the active dataset payload and stack labels within the band bounds, preventing collisions when multiple functional groups align.【F:app/main.py†L1496-L1686】 Tests assert raw unit preservation and stacked label spacing; the reference guide highlights the behaviour while awaiting updated roadmap/workplan links for documentation follow-ups.【F:tests/test_smoke_workflow.py†L144-L164】【F:tests/test_reference_ui.py†L62-L139】【F:docs/user/reference_data.md†L26-L37】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L4-L8】

**References**: `app/ui/plot_pane.py`, `app/main.py`, `tests/test_smoke_workflow.py`, `tests/test_reference_ui.py`, `docs/user/reference_data.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

## 2025-10-15 08:42 – Reference Selection & Importer Layout Cache

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Reference inspector state management and importer caching.

**Summary**: Fixed the Reference inspector so combo changes drive both the preview plot and overlay payloads, eliminating stale datasets when switching between hydrogen, IR, and JWST entries.【F:app/main.py†L953-L1074】 Added a session layout cache to the CSV importer so previously classified header arrangements reuse their confirmed column order while still validating cache hits before applying them.【F:app/services/importers/csv_importer.py†L163-L185】 Regression coverage locks in cache behaviour and overlay anchoring; roadmap/workplan linkage will be filled in once the updated planning doc lands.【F:tests/test_csv_importer.py†L92-L134】【F:tests/test_reference_ui.py†L90-L200】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L6-L9】

**References**: `app/main.py`, `app/services/importers/csv_importer.py`, `tests/test_csv_importer.py`, `tests/test_reference_ui.py`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

---

## 2025-10-15 09:10 – Importing Guide Provenance Appendix

**Author**: agent

**Context**: User documentation for export bundles.

**Summary**: Expanded the importing guide with a provenance export appendix that walks through manifest contents, canonical CSVs, copied sources, and log expectations, reinforcing the bundle hardening captured earlier.【F:docs/user/importing.md†L92-L111】 Will backfill direct roadmap/workplan links to this documentation sprint once the refreshed planning artifacts are available.【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L11-L14】

**References**: `docs/user/importing.md`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

---

## 2025-10-15 18:45 – Reference Overlay Crash Fixes

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Startup stability and overlay resilience.

**Summary**: Deferred unit toolbar initialization and hardened overlay refresh logic so the Reference tab no longer crashes during startup, handles Unicode wavenumber tokens, and keeps the main plot responsive while default samples load.【F:app/main.py†L144-L156】【F:app/main.py†L1496-L1551】 The smoke test exercises launch plus overlay toggles to confirm clean startup; I’ll append roadmap/workplan links documenting this stabilization once those updates are published.【F:tests/test_smoke_workflow.py†L30-L101】【F:docs/reviews/workplan.md†L6-L9】

**References**: `app/main.py`, `tests/test_smoke_workflow.py`, `docs/reviews/workplan.md`.

---

## 2025-10-16 13:50 – Reference UI Overlay State

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Reference inspector overlay cleanup and regression coverage.

**Summary**: Collapsed duplicate overlay attribute initialisation in the preview shell and introduced `_reset_reference_overlay_state()` so every clear path shares a single bookkeeping helper, keeping the payload dictionary and annotation list stable across toggles.【F:app/main.py†L60-L75】【F:app/main.py†L174-L192】【F:app/main.py†L229-L244】 Added a GUI regression test that flips the overlay checkbox to assert the payload object survives clears, preventing future refactors from dropping labels mid-session.【F:tests/test_reference_ui.py†L8-L118】 Updated the plotting guide and patch notes to call out the single-source overlay state for operators tracking behaviour changes.【F:docs/user/plot_tools.md†L58-L74】【F:docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md†L1-L12】

**References**: `app/main.py`, `tests/test_reference_ui.py`, `docs/user/plot_tools.md`, `docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md`.

---

## 2025-10-16 14:30 – Local Cache Integration

**Author**: agent

**Context**: Automatic LocalStore writes and persistence controls for ingest.

**Summary**: Updated the ingest pipeline to accept a shared `LocalStore`,
recording canonical-unit provenance for every import and annotating spectra with
cache metadata so repeated loads reuse prior manifests.【F:app/services/data_ingest_service.py†L11-L72】 Wired the preview shell
to construct the store, expose an environment override and menu toggle for
persistence, and feed the instance into manual and sample ingest paths.【F:app/main.py†L1-L131】 Regression coverage now mocks the
store to confirm `record` invocations and metadata reuse, and the importing guide
and patch notes document the automatic caching behaviour and opt-out flow.【F:tests/test_cache_index.py†L1-L123】【F:docs/user/importing.md†L7-L38】【F:docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md†L1-L10】

**References**: `app/services/data_ingest_service.py`, `app/main.py`,

# Patch Notes

## 2025-10-14 (Quickstart Guide) (8:00 pm)

- Added `docs/user/quickstart.md` with a step-by-step walkthrough covering launch, ingest, unit toggles, and provenance export using the bundled sample spectrum.
- Updated the Batch 3 workplan to track remaining documentation gaps and recorded the pytest run that validates the smoke workflow.
- Linked upcoming documentation sprint items back to the inventory for traceability.

## 2025-10-14 (7:20 pm)

- Logged the latest CI gate outcomes (lint, type-check, pytest) and noted the missing coverage plugin.
- Made FITS ingestion optional when `astropy` is absent, providing a clear runtime error instead of import failures.
- Updated user guidance to call out the optional dependency and created a developer snapshot documenting the CI results.

## 2025-10-14 (Documentation Inventory) (7:00 pm)

- Catalogued missing user, developer, and historical documentation deliverables in `docs/reviews/doc_inventory_2025-10-14.md` to prep for the next feature batch.
- Marked the Batch 2 workplan item complete with a reference to the new inventory document to aid scheduling.

## 2025-10-14 (6:30 pm)

- Added an automated smoke workflow test that instantiates the preview shell, ingests CSV/FITS data, exercises unit toggles, and exports a provenance bundle.
- Centralised the reusable FITS fixture under `tests/conftest.py` to support regression suites.
- Documented the new smoke validation loop for developers and provided a matching user checklist.

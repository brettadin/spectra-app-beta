- **Publication Tools**: LaTeX export, figure generation, citation generation
- **Plugin System**: Custom analysis modules, user-defined visualizations
- **Collaborative Features**: Session sharing, real-time collaboration

## What's Working Well (Don't Need to Change)

1. **Remote Data Fetching**: Users can fetch real spectral data from MAST archives
   - File ‚Üí Fetch Remote Data (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Search for targets like "Jupiter", "Mars", "Vega", "WASP-39 b"
   - Downloads cached locally for offline use
   
2. **Data Ingest**: Multi-format support with provenance tracking
   - CSV, FITS, JCAMP-DX, ASCII formats
   - Automatic unit detection and conversion
   - Header parsing with heuristics
   
3. **Unit Handling**: Canonical storage with display-time conversion
   - All spectra stored in nm (nanometers)
   - Display in √Ö, ¬µm, cm‚Åª¬π as needed
   - Idempotent conversions (toggle safely)
   
4. **Provenance**: Full audit trail for scientific integrity
   - Manifest exports with operation history
   - Source attribution for all data
   - Citation tracking for remote sources

## Known Issues & Pain Points

Based on conversation history and workplan:

1. **Element Spectral Line Searches**: User reports issues with spectral line searches not working
   - Current: NIST ASD integration via astroquery
   - Status: Needs investigation (not crashing, but may not return expected results)
   - Priority: High (core feature)

2. **Manual Download Requirement**: User wants more direct data access
   - Current: Remote Data dialog downloads to cache, then ingest
   - Enhancement: Could streamline with direct ingest from search results
   - Priority: Medium (UX improvement)

3. **FITS File Handling**: User mentions difficulties with .fits files
   - Current: FITS importer exists, tested with MAST products
   - Issue: May need better error messages or format detection
   - Priority: Medium (investigate specific cases)

## Next Steps & Recommendations

## Testing Strategy

All new features should include:
- [ ] Unit tests in `tests/`
- [ ] Integration tests where applicable
- [ ] Qt UI tests (offscreen mode)
- [ ] Regression tests for bug fixes
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Patch notes entry with timestamp
- [ ] Knowledge log entry for architectural changes

## Conclusion

The Spectra App has made significant progress on the enhancement plan, particularly in:
- Remote data integration (MAST, NIST, curated archives)
- Data ingest pipeline with provenance
- Unit handling and visualization
- Documentation and development workflows

The next phase should focus on:
1. Fixing any remaining issues with existing features (spectral line search)
2. Improving discoverability and UX (documentation, streamlined workflows)
3. Quick-win UI enhancements (dataset removal, shortcuts)
4. Expanding data source coverage (more telescopes, ground-based)

The foundation is solid. Now it's about polishing the user experience and expanding coverage.

## purpose of brains folder ##

you should write things you learn and find out as unique brain entries.
you should connect them in some way, such that these brain files function quite literally like neurons.
All ai agents are expected to read and write brain documentaion. 
Make files names clean and consistent for easy referencing. 
Discuss all thoughts, thought processes, logic, and ideas relevant to your input in the file.

# Worklog index

Daily worklogs live here as `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. These are narrative session logs that complement the tactical **workplan** (`docs/reviews/workplan.md`).

Each entry should include:
- Summary of changes (what/why/how)
- User-visible effects and validation steps
- Known issues and next steps
- Links to `docs/brains/*` neurons and `docs/atlas/*` maps
- Cross-reference to workplan batch items when applicable

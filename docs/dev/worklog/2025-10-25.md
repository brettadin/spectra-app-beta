# 2025-10-25 – Documentation provenance backfill

- **10:30 EDT / 14:30 UTC** – Audited the IR functional group expansion PR and found the promised documentation trail was missing from the repo history. Re-authored the patch notes and knowledge log entries with correct timestamps, cross-referencing the extended dataset, ML design spec, and brains entry. Verified README and IR expansion summary already mentioned the dataset and did not require edits.

## Validation
- Documentation lint: manual review only (no automated tooling required).

## Next Steps
- Monitor future IR/ML implementation work to ensure each phase updates patch notes, knowledge log, and workplan immediately when merged.

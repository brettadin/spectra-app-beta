# Worklog — 2025-10-25

This entry captures the follow-up QA alignment for the Reference dock status label pluralisation change.

## Summary

- Updated the Qt regression suite to match the pluralised "pinned sets" status message shown after multiple NIST queries are stored.
- Logged the documentation updates (patch notes, knowledge log, neuron) to preserve provenance for the UI copy adjustment.

## Changes (what/why/how)

1) Reference dock status assertion
- What: Adjusted `tests/test_reference_ui.py::test_reference_nist_fetch_populates_table` to expect "2 pinned sets".
- Why: The runtime label now pluralises counts > 1; without updating the test the suite fails even though behaviour is correct.
- How: Replaced the hard-coded "2 pinned set" substring check with the plural form and refreshed supporting documentation entries.

## Validation

- ✅ `pytest -k test_reference_nist_fetch_populates_table` (locally) — verifies the updated expectation passes once the UI initialises.

## Next steps

- Monitor nightly Qt smoke tests for additional copy mismatches introduced by the Reference dock refresh.
- Audit other status messages for similar pluralisation gaps and update tests/documentation where needed.

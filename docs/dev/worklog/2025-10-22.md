# Worklog — 2025-10-22

This log captures today’s stability work on Remote Data, importers, and ingest. It’s written for all agents (human and automated). Cross-links into the brains are provided to seed long-term memory.

## Summary

- Stabilized Remote Data dialog: search/filtering, multi-select downloads, metadata preview, and non-blocking worker cleanup.
- Fixed NIST threading and registration issues; UI updates now occur on the main thread.
- Reworked MAST downloads to use an isolated temp directory and persistent copies. Added a direct HTTP fallback path for mast: URIs when astroquery stalls or returns an empty file.
- Improved importer robustness (FITS column discovery, CSV heuristics) and expanded File → Open filters.
- Introduced an in-memory ingestion API `DataIngestService.ingest_bytes` to enable “plot without manual download” flows.

## Changes (what/why/how)

1) Remote Data dialog hardening
- What: Fixed duplicate UI build, selection bounds during filtering, and thread cleanup to prevent freezes.
- Why: Avoided the “QThread::wait: Thread tried to wait on itself” warning and selection crashes.
- How: Single `_build_ui` call; moved worker cleanup to a `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` to avoid blocking waits; guarded selection indexes on preview update.

2) Filtering and UX
- What: Added All/Spectra/Images/Other filters; multi-select count appears on Download & Import button; improved status text.
- Why: Large result sets need quick narrowing; clearer state reduces confusion.
- How: `_should_show_record`, `_on_filter_changed`, filtered record mapping maintained to align table → preview/selection.

3) Non-spectral file skip on import
- What: Skipped obvious non-spectral types during bulk ingest (gif/png/jpg/tif/svg/txt/log/xml/html/htm/json/md).
- Why: Avoids ingest confusion from previews, thumbs, and logs appearing in spectroscopic searches.
- How: Guard inside `_DownloadWorker.run` before dispatching to ingest.

4) MAST download stability
- What: Reworked `_fetch_via_mast` to download into an isolated temp dir, copy to a persistent temp file (suffix preserved), and clean up afterwards; added `_fetch_via_mast_direct` fallback using the public MAST Download API.
- Why: Prevents 0% stalls tied to temp cleanup races and adds a resilient path when astroquery progress hangs.
- How: `tempfile.mkdtemp` + `shutil.copyfile`; verify file size; fallback to `https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0.1/Download/file?uri=...` when empty. See brains/mast_download_fallback.md.

5) NIST line search fixes
- What: Corrected registration typo and ensured UI updates land on main thread.
- Why: Prior crashes traced to cross-thread widget mutation.
- How: Connected signals to dedicated slots and used timers for cleanup; see brains/nist_threading.md.

6) Importers
- CSV: Heuristics for column detection and unit inference; bundle detection for Spectra exports with improved messages.
- FITS: Broadened wavelength/flux candidates and clearer “Required column not found” errors listing available columns.

7) In-memory ingest
- What: Added `DataIngestService.ingest_bytes(content, suggested_name=None, extension=None)`.
- Why: Enables direct streaming from remote sources without asking the user to pick a file path.
- How: Writes to a temp file with correct suffix, delegates to existing ingest pipeline; LocalStore records as usual. See brains/ingest_service_bytes.md.

## Observed issues today

- Exoplanet Archive occasional `NoResultsWarning`—this is benign for free-text queries. We have fallback logic that widens to MAST-only searches where sensible.
- Some FITS remain tricky when columns have mission-specific names (e.g., IUE/STIS variants). The importer now reports available columns; broader detection is a next step.
- MAST downloads sometimes report 0% and appear stuck; our fallback to direct HTTP has been added.

## Next steps (execution-ready)

1) Remote “Quick Plot” (no intermediate UI save)
- Add `RemoteDataService.fetch_bytes(record)` leveraging either astroquery or direct HTTP.
- Wire a “Quick Plot” button beside “Download & Import” to use `ingest_bytes` and plot immediately; still record into LocalStore for provenance.

2) FITS breadth
- Add multi-extension selection when multiple BinTableHDUs exist; consider WCS-based spectral axis detection.
- Expand wavelength/flux column aliases for STIS/IUE/NICMOS/JWST conventions.

3) Grouping and coverage
- Group results by (target, mission, instrument), compute/visualize wavelength ranges across selections.

4) Auto-citations
- Extract and surface citation metadata in preview and propagate into provenance manifests.

## How to validate

- UI: Search ExoSystems for “HD 189733 b”, toggle filters, select a few spectra, and click Download & Import. Confirm ingest count and no freezes.
- MAST fallback: If a file appears stuck at 0%, the fallback should kick in—confirm the file is persisted into LocalStore and plotted.
- NIST lines: Issue a simple query (e.g., `element=Fe; ion=II`) and confirm a generated CSV imports and plots without thread warnings.

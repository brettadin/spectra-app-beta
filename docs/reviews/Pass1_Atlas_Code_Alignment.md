Pass 1 ‚Äî Atlas ‚Üî Code Alignment (what‚Äôs solid, what‚Äôs partial, what‚Äôs missing)
What I reviewed (from your ZIP)
	‚Ä¢ Docs: docs/atlas/* (index + chapters 1‚Äì31), docs/history/* (MASTER_PROMPT, RUNNER_PROMPT, PATCH_NOTES, KNOWLEDGE_LOG), docs/user/* (quickstart, units_reference, importing, remote_data, plot_tools, in_app_documentation), specs/* (architecture, system_design), AGENTS.md, START_HERE.md, reports/*.
	‚Ä¢ Code: app/services/* (units, ingest, importers CSV/FITS/JCAMP, overlay, math, provenance, remote, line_shapes, store, spectrum), app/ui/* (plot pane, palettes, remote dialog), app/main.py, app/data/reference/* (NIST H, JWST, IR groups, line-shape placeholders).
	‚Ä¢ Tests: 25 files including units round-trip, importer heuristics, remote services, knowledge-log, overlay/line-shape, provenance/export, smoke workflow, plot perf stub.
Alignment snapshot
Area	Status	Notes
Units canon / idempotent conversions	‚úÖ Solid	UnitsService stores canon (nm + absorbance), round-trip tests exist (test_units_roundtrip.py). User docs align.
Ingest (CSV/FITS/JCAMP)	‚úÖ Solid	Heuristics + header handling; JCAMP present. Provenance recorded. Multi-select import working.
Provenance & export bundles	‚úÖ Solid	ProvenanceService writes manifest + sources + CSVs + log; regression tests exist; docs describe structure.
Remote data (NIST/MAST)	‚úÖ Solid	RemoteDataService + RemoteDataDialog with validation hints; optional deps guarded; caching via LocalStore; tests cover adapters + dialog behavior.
Plotting performance (LOD)	‚úÖ Solid	PyQtGraph with max-points budget (configurable; persisted via QSettings); perf stub tests.
Library/History/Knowledge-log	‚úÖ/üü®	Knowledge-log service + docs; Library view mentioned & tested; ensure the Library dock class is explicitly implemented/linked in UI (I see tests, but no standalone library_* UI file‚Äîlikely in main.py).
Line-shape previews (Doppler/pressure/Stark)	‚úÖ/üü®	Placeholder models + tests; UI previews via Reference tab; not yet a full Calibration Manager acting on user data.
Uncertainty ribbons	üü® Partial	I see uncertainty rendering for some reference plots in main.py; make sure imported datasets can show ribbons and that they‚Äôre toggleable + persisted.
Identification/scoring rubric	‚ùå Missing	Atlas Ch.7 + Ch.11 specify explainable scoring; I don‚Äôt see a SimilarityService/ScoringService yet.
Calibration pipeline (LSF honesty + convolve-down + velocity frames)	‚ùå Missing	Atlas Ch.6 expects an explicit manager. Code has line-shape helpers but no full pipeline (LSF banners, kernel choice, velocity frame UI).
Architecture surface for multi-UI future	üü® Partial	Atlas Chapters 14/29 outline React/TypeScript UI + Python Engine (API). Code is PySide6 desktop. This conflict needs an RFC to set a seam (keep PySide6 now, extract an Engine API).
Functional-group ML tagging (IR)	üü® Planned	Reference JSON + UI overlay OK; predictive model integration (auto-tag + table) not wired yet.
Packaging hygiene	üü® Minor	ZIP includes __pycache__/ and .pyc files. .gitignore likely covers it, but make sure release zips exclude them.

Gaps ‚Üí concrete fixes (files & actions)
1) Calibration Manager (Atlas Ch.6)
Why: Align with Atlas ‚ÄúLSF honesty,‚Äù ‚Äúconvolve down,‚Äù and explicit frames (air/vacuum, heliocentric).
	‚Ä¢ Add app/services/calibration_service.py
		‚óã Kernels: Gaussian (instrumental LSF), Lorentzian (pressure), Voigt (compose), Doppler shift (km/s).
		‚óã API: apply(data, steps=[...]) -> Spectrum, transforms[] (each step: type, params, citation).
	‚Ä¢ UI: CalibrationDock (or a panel in Inspector) with: target resolution, kernel picker, ‚Äúconvolve down to lowest,‚Äù velocity frame selector, banner that states the active LSF + params.
	‚Ä¢ Provenance: Append transform steps to export manifest; show ‚ÄúLSF banner‚Äù badge over the plot.
	‚Ä¢ Tests: synthetic signals ‚Üí assert matched FWHM; Doppler 30 km/s shift; provenance step order.
2) Uncertainty on imported datasets
	‚Ä¢ Extend DataIngestService to accept optional œÉ arrays; table columns ‚Äúy ¬± œÉy‚Äù; store with Spectrum metadata.
	‚Ä¢ Plot: in PlotPane, add ribbon layer for selected traces; toggle via Inspector; persist via QSettings.
	‚Ä¢ Docs: update plot_tools.md and units_reference.md with examples and limits.
	‚Ä¢ Tests: headless rendering of ribbons + toggle persistence.
3) Explainable Identification/Scoring (Atlas Ch.7 & Ch.11)
	‚Ä¢ Add app/services/similarity_service.py and scoring_service.py
		‚óã Peak matching (tolerance-aware), cross-correlation, cosine similarity.
		‚óã Output per-feature contributions + uncertainties + priors.
	‚Ä¢ UI: ‚ÄúExplain‚Äù drawer shows per-feature table; export as CSV inside provenance bundle.
	‚Ä¢ Docs: docs/user/identification.md + rubric table; acceptance thresholds.
	‚Ä¢ Tests: seeded determinism; jitter tolerance; score deltas reflect calibration shifts.
4) Architecture seam for future multi-UI
	‚Ä¢ RFC: docs/rfc/RFC-YYYYMMDD-frontend-architecture.md with options:
A) remain PySide6, B) React/Tauri + Engine API, C) hybrid (extract Engine API now).
	‚Ä¢ If accepted (hybrid): add app/engine/api.py (thin fa√ßade over services) with a clean, documented surface; optional FastAPI adapter in tools/engine_http/ behind a feature flag.
	‚Ä¢ Tests: contract tests for engine methods; keep PySide6 shell fully functional.
5) Functional-group prediction flow
	‚Ä¢ Adapter structure in app/services/ml_service.py with optional model loader (CNN pipeline).
	‚Ä¢ UI: ‚ÄúIdentify functional groups‚Äù button annotates IR regions + writes to data table notes.
	‚Ä¢ Provenance: model version + commit/weights hash + input ranges + confidence.
	‚Ä¢ Tests: mock model path; deterministic annotations on fixtures.
6) Library/History Dock clarifications
	‚Ä¢ If Library dock UI is embedded in main.py, extract to app/ui/library_dock.py for clarity (already tested behavior).
	‚Ä¢ Ensure cross-link from a Library item ‚Üí opens knowledge-log summary, as described in patch notes.
7) Packaging hygiene
	‚Ä¢ Add ZIP task to exclude __pycache__/ and .pyc (keep .gitignore as is).
	‚Ä¢ Verify app/version meta (JSON or module) exists and is injected into manifests.

Streamlining opportunities (quick wins)
	‚Ä¢ Inspector grouping: Group overlay/line-shape/uncertainty controls and persist toggles; reduce panel hopping.
	‚Ä¢ Plot presets: You already added palettes + LOD presets‚Äîadd a one-click ‚ÄúTeaching mode‚Äù preset (large fonts, high-contrast, slow animations off).
	‚Ä¢ Error paths: Remote dialog already blocks empty searches‚Äîmirror this pattern across importers (e.g., explicit error for missing headers with a ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù link to docs).
	‚Ä¢ Docs map: Add docs/MAP.md linking Atlas chapters ‚Üí code modules/tests (a 1-page index reduces onboarding time).
	‚Ä¢ Manifest schema file: Commit docs/specs/provenance_schema.json and validate in tests.

Where Atlas and code disagree
	‚Ä¢ UI stack: Atlas (Ch.14/29) describes React/TypeScript UI; code (and specs folder) currently endorse PySide6. This is an intentional fork‚Äîtreat it via RFC, don‚Äôt silently switch.
	‚Ä¢ Calibration presence: Atlas expects a full manager; code has placeholders and previews. Implement manager as above.
	‚Ä¢ Identification rubric: Atlas specifies explainable scoring; code hasn‚Äôt got that service yet.

Sanity checks that look great
	‚Ä¢ Canon & conversions (and tests)
	‚Ä¢ Ingest across CSV/FITS/JCAMP with heuristics
	‚Ä¢ Remote data adapters + validation + caching
	‚Ä¢ Provenance bundle layout + tests
	‚Ä¢ Plot LOD budget with persistence
	‚Ä¢ Palette presets and accessibility push

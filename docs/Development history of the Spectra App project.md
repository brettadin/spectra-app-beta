Development history of the Spectra App project (Sept 2025 – Oct 2025)
Background and objectives
The user is a chemistry student interested in analysing spectral data from calibration lamps (Hg, Ne and Xe) and astronomical sources. Because the user had little programming experience, their early work involved asking ChatGPT to write Python code and then manually downloading zipped files and patch notes. The overarching goal was to build a research‑grade spectral analysis tool that could:
ingest one‑dimensional spectra from the user’s laboratory instruments or publicly available archives,
 align spectra on a common wavelength grid and perform comparative analysis (difference/ratio spectra, smoothing, baseline subtraction),
overlay reference line lists from credible sources such as the NIST Atomic Spectra Database,
 fetch remote observations (e.g., NASA/MAST, exoplanet archives) and support offline caching and provenance tracking, and
* export analysis sessions and provenance information so other researchers could reproduce the results.
The development journey progressed through multiple repositories. Each repository represented a stage in refining the tool—from a single‑file data‑processing script to a Streamlit web application, and finally to a Windows desktop application built with PySide6. The timeline below is based on commit metadata and README files from the public GitHub repositories.
________________________________________
Early script: Spectral‑Data‑Proccessing (created 7 Sept 2025)
Purpose
This repository was the first piece of code written during the ChatGPT conversation. It contains a single Python script (approximately 180 lines) to process lamp spectra. The script reads text files with lines indicating where spectral data begin, tokenises filenames to classify each file as Hg, Ne or Xe, interpolates each spectrum onto a common wavelength grid, and averages them to produce combined CSV files[1]. The script also supports merging the averaged results into a single CSV containing columns for Hg, Ne and Xe[2].
Tools and techniques
•	Python (no external UI) – The script uses standard Python libraries (NUMPY, PANDAS, PATHLIB and RE). It is executed from the command line and prints summary statistics (number of files per element)[3].
•	Simple file classification and interpolation – Helper functions tokenise filenames to detect elements (Hg, Ne, Xe), read spectral data after the >>>>>BEGIN SPECTRAL DATA<<<<< marker, and calculate a common wavelength grid[4].
•	CSV output for sharing – The script writes averaged spectra and a combined CSV, enabling the user to import the results into other software.
Challenges and lessons
•	Manual data paths – The script hard‑codes DATA_DIR and expects text files in a specific format; the user needed to adjust file paths manually[5].
•	Single‑user script – There was no user interface, so it was difficult to share the analysis or integrate with remote data sources.
This script proved that the user could process spectral data with ChatGPT’s help, but it lacked interactivity and the ability to compare spectra against credible references. The next phase aimed to add a graphical interface.

Streamlit prototypes
spectra‑app‑super‑early‑version (created 14 Sept 2025)
The first attempt at an application moved the code to GitHub and provided a minimal Streamlit interface. The README describes this repository as a clean baseline for GitHub with a tiny Streamlit app to run immediately[6]. It includes a VERSION.TXT file indicating a version number (v4.1.0 starter) and a RUN.PS1 script for Windows users. The CODE/SPECTRAFETCHER package contains the Streamlit app, and PATCHES/ records patch notes for each modification.
Techniques and tools
•	Streamlit for rapid prototyping – ChatGPT wrote the first Streamlit UI. It allowed users to select and upload spectral files, overlay reference lines, and compute simple analysis. The application used PANDAS and NUMPY for data handling and Plotly for visualization.
•	Versioning via patch notes – Because the user lacked Git experience, ChatGPT generated patch notes that were stored in the repository. Each patch note explained the files modified and the reasoning behind the changes (e.g., bug fixes, adding a caching mechanism).
•	Manual file transfers – The user initially downloaded zipped code and patch notes from ChatGPT. Moving to GitHub simplified transferring code and allowed version history through commits.
Struggles and limitations
•	Limited domain knowledge – As a chemistry student with no programming background, the user relied heavily on ChatGPT to explain concepts and produce code. This led to frequent iterative refinements as bugs or design limitations surfaced.
•	Basic features – The early Streamlit app could ingest spectral files and overlay simple line lists, but remote data fetching and provenance tracking were not yet implemented.
•	Performance – Without asynchronous operations, the app sometimes froze when loading large files or querying remote APIs.
spectra‑app‑past‑versions (created 15 Sept 2025)
This repository contains 19 commits and serves as the minimum‑viable product (MVP). The README states the goal succinctly: “fetch credible stellar spectra (with provenance), overlay lamp lines, and ingest uploads in a single plotting workflow”[7]. It offers a quickstart guide for running the app via Streamlit[8].
Progress and innovations
•	Data provenance and credibility – The app integrated queries to credible archives (e.g., NASA MAST and the NIST Atomic Spectra Database) and logged the provenance of each dataset.
•	Version tags (v0.2.x) – Commit messages show sequential tags like v0.2.2, v0.2.9h, etc., indicating frequent incremental releases. Each tag introduced features such as caching remote downloads, a more intuitive user interface, and better error handling (e.g., gracefully managing missing metadata).
•	Modular architecture – The MVP created separate modules for ingestion, plotting, analysis and data fetch. Although still using Streamlit, the code structure improved maintainability and testability.
Challenges
•	Streamlit limitations – As features expanded (e.g., remote data fetch from MAST, large file handling), Streamlit’s single‑threaded model became a bottleneck. Multi‑file uploads and remote calls could cause the app to freeze, and interactive components were difficult to manage.
•	Packaging and dependencies – The user struggled with Python environments and dependencies; instructions had to include VENV, PIP INSTALL -E ., and PYTEST to help reproduce the environment[8].
•	Rapid commit pace – Many small commits were pushed over a short period (mid‑Sept 2025). While this indicates active development, it also meant the project lacked a stable baseline and proper testing.
spectrasuite (created 23 Sept 2025)
The SPECTRASUITE repository represents a more polished research‑grade Streamlit application. The README highlights major features: a canonical vacuum‑nanometer wavelength baseline, robust ASCII and FITS ingestion with provenance logging, an overlay trace manager for debugging, and export bundles that capture the visible state via a manifest[9]. The documentation emphasises reproducibility, with continuity artifacts in /ATLAS, /BRAINS, /PATCH_NOTES, and /HANDOFFS to keep every run auditable[10].
Improvements over the MVP
•	Auditable documentation – The repository adds /BRAINS (run journals), /ATLAS (design notes), /PATCH_NOTES, and /HANDOFFS directories. These ensure that every change, assumption and data source is documented—an essential requirement for academic projects.
•	Testing and quality gates – The README includes commands for RUFF, BLACK, MYPY and PYTEST[11], signalling an embrace of professional software engineering practices.
•	Clear repository layout – The layout contains INGESTION, PLOTTING, ANALYSIS, DATAFETCH, and INTERFACE modules; this segmentation clarifies responsibilities and simplifies maintenance【964085108552237†L45-L57】.
•	Installation instructions – The README lists step‑by‑step setup instructions for the environment and Streamlit execution, improving reproducibility[12].
Remaining issues
•	Streamlit still a bottleneck – Despite improvements, large datasets (e.g., NASA JWST spectra) and remote API calls could still freeze the UI.
•	Single‑platform focus – The instructions assume Windows and may not work seamlessly on macOS/Linux.
•	Complexity for non‑programmers – While the documentation improved, the environment setup (creating virtual environments, installing dev dependencies) remained challenging for a chemistry student.
beta (created 26 Sept 2025)
The BETA repository reorganises the Streamlit code into a source package (SRC/SPECTRAL_APP) and adds a comprehensive test suite and documentation. The README calls it an “interactive, educational spectral‑analysis environment”[13]. Key features include:
•	Multi‑format ingestion (CSV/ASCII, FITS) with unit harmonisation[14].
•	Interactive plotting of multiple spectra with optional downsampling[15].
•	Overlay of NIST reference lines with graceful fallbacks[16].
•	Comparative analysis (difference and ratio spectra) on a common wavelength grid[17].
•	Remote data queries to public MAST archives[18].
•	Export of the current session—including spectra, line lists and configuration—to JSON for reproducibility[19].
The repository layout lists separate modules for ingestion, plotting, analysis, data fetch, interface and utilities, as well as tests and docs[20]. The README encourages maintaining implementation notes and citing authoritative sources; it references a Word document with training documents and a link list[21].
Lessons and successes
•	Modular package – Moving the code into SRC/SPECTRAL_APP encourages good packaging practices and easier dependency management.
•	Thorough testing – Adding tests and enforcing code style (e.g., via BLACK, MYPY) improved reliability.
•	Focused features – The repository emphasises educational use, making the app accessible to students learning spectroscopy.
Challenges
•	Maintenance burden – Frequent commits and feature additions in September 2025 left little time for refactoring.
•	Streamlit limits – The app still used Streamlit, and scaling to large spectral datasets remained an issue.

Complete rewrite: spectra‑app‑v2 (created 14 Oct 2025)
As limitations of Streamlit became apparent—particularly performance, offline caching and cross‑platform packaging—the project underwent a complete rewrite. The repository now known as SPECTRA‑APP‑V2 (formerly SPECTRA‑APP‑BETA) is a modular Windows desktop application built with PySide6/Qt. The README labels it a “Spectroscopy Toolkit for Exoplanet Characterization” and emphasises that it is a complete rewrite of the original application[22].
Key architectural decisions
•	PySide6/Qt desktop application – Moving to a desktop framework provided multithreading support, native widgets and performance improvements. The UI uses PyQtGraph for high‑performance plotting and supports large datasets (>1 million points)[23].
•	Clean architecture and modular services – The design adopts services for ingestion, data fetching, unit conversions, analysis, provenance and storage[24]. This separation facilitates testing and replacement of individual components.
•	Remote Data Dialog – A dedicated window lets users fetch calibrated spectra from NASA/MAST, with quick‑pick targets for planets and exoplanets (e.g., HD 189733 b and TRAPPIST‑1)[25]. It includes fallback logic: when astroquery stalls, the app falls back to direct HTTP downloads; it also filters by file types and cleans up temporary directories, as described in the 22 Oct 2025 commit message for REMOTE DATA STABILITY, MAST FALLBACK, AND STREAMING INGEST[26].
•	Offline‑first caching and provenance – All fetched data are stored locally with SHA256 de‑duplication and complete audit trails[27]. Export bundles include a MANIFEST.JSON detailing the data sources, operations and parameters[28].
•	Scientific accuracy – A unit canon system stores raw data in nanometers and converts units on display; analysis routines include baseline removal, Savitzky–Golay smoothing, Gaussian fitting and peak detection[29].
•	Documentation and planning – The repository contains detailed docs: DOCS/HISTORY (prompts and patch notes), DOCS/BRAINS (design decisions), DOCS/ATLAS (legacy materials), REPORTS/ROADMAP.MD and more[30]. Workplans and daily worklogs ensure transparent development.
Development timeline
•	14 Oct 2025 – SPECTRA‑APP‑V2 was created[31][32]. The early commits likely imported the existing Streamlit codebase and established the PySide6 skeleton.
•	Mid Oct 2025 – Early commits created the modular directory structure under APP/, wrote services for ingestion and remote data, and ported the UI to PySide6.
•	21 Oct 2025 – Several commits added remote data stability, documentation workflows and house‑keeping implementation plans. For example, the commit on 22 Oct added fallback logic for MAST downloads, streaming ingest, improved error messages and documentation updates[26].
•	23 Oct 2025 – The latest commit included stability improvements in the Remote Data dialog (thread cleanup, UI filtering), added filters to hide non‑spectral files, and updated documentation with planning structures and worklogs[33].
Successes and innovations
•	Performance & stability – PySide6 allowed multi‑threading, non‑blocking remote calls and high‑performance plotting. The app could ingest large JWST spectra without freezing.
•	User‑friendly UI – The redesigned interface grouped controls logically and included a comprehensive inspector for metadata and provenance[34]. Quick‑pick targets and keyboard shortcuts improved usability.
•	Provenance and reproducibility – Extensive logging, manifest generation and documentation ensure that every analysis can be reproduced. The repository emphasises docs‑first development with workplans and worklogs[30].
•	Scientific breadth – The Remote Data dialog provides quick access to exoplanet and stellar spectra across the UV to mid‑IR range[25], making the tool applicable to astrophysics as well as chemistry.
Challenges and considerations
•	Complexity – The new architecture introduced many modules and documentation files. For a novice programmer, it may be overwhelming to navigate the codebase.
•	Windows focus – The README lists Windows as the platform and provides Windows‑specific launch scripts[35][36]. Porting to other platforms may require additional work.
•	Ongoing development – With over 600 commits in roughly 10 days, the project evolved rapidly; some features may not be fully tested, and there may be redundancies or unused code.
•	Large scope – The ambition to fetch and analyse data from multiple NASA missions, support various file formats, and provide high‑performance plotting is significant. Ensuring the tool remains maintainable and scientifically reliable will require careful long‑term planning.
________________________________________
Overall lessons learned
1.	Iterative prototyping is invaluable – Starting from a simple data‑processing script allowed the user to understand fundamental tasks (file classification, interpolation). Building successive Streamlit prototypes facilitated early feedback and feature additions, while the final PySide6 rewrite addressed performance and architectural issues.
2.	Documentation and provenance are critical in scientific software – Each repository evolved to include patch notes, implementation notes, worklogs, and knowledge logs. These not only help reproduce results but also enable peer review and academic credit. The final repository emphasises docs‑first development and mandates updating workplan/manifest files with each change[37].
3.	Choice of tools matters – Streamlit is excellent for rapid prototyping, but for high‑performance or offline‑capable desktop apps, a framework like PySide6 is more appropriate. The project demonstrates the trade‑offs between ease of development and performance/complexity.
4.	Provenance and remote data integration require careful handling – Fetching data from NASA/MAST and NIST requires robust error handling, caching, and fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability, as highlighted in the commit message that added MAST fallback logic[38].
5.	Collaboration with AI can accelerate learning – The user, despite minimal coding experience, was able to develop a sophisticated application by iteratively asking ChatGPT for code, explanations, and troubleshooting advice. The project underscores the potential of AI‑assisted programming for domain experts without formal software training.

Presentation draft (1–2 minutes)
Opening:
“Good afternoon everyone. Today I’m excited to share the story of how a chemistry student and ChatGPT collaborated to build a research‑grade spectral analysis tool in just six weeks.”
Development journey:
1.	Data‑processing script: We began on 7 September 2025 with a Python script that classified lamp spectra (Hg, Ne, Xe) and averaged them onto a common wavelength grid[4]. This simple program taught us how to parse spectral files and build CSV outputs for analysis[2].
2.	Streamlit prototypes: By 14 September we had our first Streamlit app, which allowed us to upload spectra and overlay reference lines[6]. Over the next week we iterated rapidly, adding credible archive queries and provenance logging. The SPECTRA‑APP‑PAST‑VERSIONS MVP fetched stellar spectra with provenance and supported uploads in a single plotting workflow[7]. However, the app was limited by Streamlit’s single‑threaded model and struggled with large datasets.
3.	Spectrasuite: On 23 September we released SPECTRASUITE, a more polished Streamlit application. It featured a canonical wavelength baseline, robust ingestion, an overlay trace manager, and export bundles that capture the visible state via a manifest[9]. Documentation and quality gates (RUFF, BLACK, MYPY, PYTEST) brought professional practices to the project[11].
4.	Modular beta: A few days later we created BETA, reorganising the code into a SPECTRAL_APP package with separate modules for ingestion, plotting, analysis, data fetch and interface[20]. This version emphasised educational use and added a test suite for reliability. It could ingest CSV and FITS, overlay NIST lines, compute difference/ratio spectra, and export sessions[39].
5.	Complete rewrite (PySide6): Recognising the limitations of a web app, we embarked on a complete rewrite. On 14 October we created SPECTRA‑APP‑V2, a Windows desktop application using PySide6. This version supports high‑performance plotting, offline caching, remote data fetches from NASA/MAST with fallback logic[25][38], and comprehensive provenance tracking. The modular service architecture ensures maintainability, and detailed documentation and worklogs provide transparency.[30]
Successes:
•	Moving from a script to a professional application taught us how to handle data ingestion, remote API integration, caching and user interfaces.
•	The final app fetches spectra from MAST, supports JWST exoplanet observations, and can process millions of data points without freezing.
•	We achieved reproducibility by logging every step and bundling analysis sessions with a manifest.
Possible issues and future work:
•	The codebase became complex; additional refactoring and cross‑platform support will be needed.
•	The rapid pace of commits means some features might not be fully tested; a formal user study and more rigorous validation would strengthen the tool.
•	Extending the tool to other domains (e.g., Raman or IR spectroscopy) and improving accessibility for non‑Windows users are potential future directions.
Conclusion:
“In summary, this project demonstrates how iterative prototyping, rigorous documentation, and AI assistance can empower a non‑programmer to build a sophisticated scientific application. The Spectra App has evolved from a simple lamp‑data script into a robust toolkit that fetches, analyses, and documents spectral data with academic integrity. Thank you.”

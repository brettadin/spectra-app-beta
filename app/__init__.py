"""Entry package for the Spectraâ€‘Redesign application.

This package contains the PySide6 UI and supporting services.  The modules
included here are intentionally minimal; their sole purpose is to provide
clear boundaries between the UI (presentation layer), the service layer
responsible for data operations, and the plugin layer to be built later.

New code should be added as separate modules or packages under the
`services` or `widgets` namespaces.  See the documentation in
`specs/system_design.md` and `specs/plugin_dev_guide.md` for guidance.

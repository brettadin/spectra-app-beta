If you need a longer contribution guide, please see `docs/CONTRIBUTING_FULL.md` or ask maintainers.

AI agents must adhere to additional guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability:

Pre-Development Phase

1. **Context Loading**
   - Always start by loading the MASTER_PROMPT and RUNNER_PROMPT
   - Review recent entries in `docs/ai_log/` for context
   - Check `reports/feature_parity_matrix.md` for legacy compatibility

2. **Work Plan Creation**

   ```bash
   # Create detailed work plan
   docs/reviews/workplan_AI_[timestamp].md
   ```

   - Include specific file changes and implementations
   - Define test cases and validation criteria
   - List documentation that needs updating

Development Session Protocol

1. **Session Initialization**
   - Declare session start in work plan
   - State current goals and constraints
   - Confirm understanding of non-negotiable principles

2. **Implementation Loop**

   PLAN â†’ IMPLEMENT â†’ TEST â†’ DOCUMENT â†’ VALIDATE

3. **Quality Gates**
   - **Before Coding**: Verify against UI contract and architecture boundaries
   - **During Coding**: Follow existing patterns in `app/services/`
   - **After Coding**: Run full test suite and performance validation

Documentation Requirements for AI Work

1. **AI Log Entry** (`docs/ai_log/`)

   ```markdown
   # YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM - [Feature Description]
   
   ## Changes Made
   - File: description of changes
   - File: description of changes
   
   ## Rationale
   Explanation of design decisions and approach
   
   ## Tests Added/Modified
   - test_file.py: description
   
   ## Documentation Updated
   - docs/path: description
   
   ## Performance Impact
   - UI responsiveness: [verified/maintained/degraded]
   - Memory usage: [unchanged/increased/decreased]
   ```

2. **Version Management**
   - Bump the semantic version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Update any mirrored defaults (e.g. `ProvenanceService.app_version`)
   - Record user-visible changes in `docs/history/PATCH_NOTES.md`

3. **Provenance Tracking**
   - Ensure all data operations record source and transformations
   - Maintain unit conversion integrity
   - Preserve citation and attribution information

Safety and Validation Rules

1. **Non-Negotiable Checks**
   - [ ] Desktop-first (PySide6/Qt only)
   - [ ] Offline-first data caching
   - [ ] Unit canon preservation (x=nm storage)
   - [ ] Provenance tracking intact
   - [ ] Performance budget maintained

2. **Regression Prevention**
   - Run full test suite before and after changes
   - Verify UI contract compliance
   - Check for unit conversion idempotency
   - Validate with sample datasets

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful degradation for remote services
   - Provide clear error messages to users
   - Maintain application stability during failures

### Branch Strategy for AI Work

```bash
# Branch naming convention
git checkout -b ai/feature-name-YYYYMMDD

# Work in small, atomic commits
git commit -m "feat: describe specific change
- Detail 1
- Detail 2
- Tests: [added/modified/na]
- Docs: [updated/na]"
```

### AI-Specific Best Practices

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
   - Use type hints and docstrings
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Prefer composition over inheritance

2. **Testing Approach**
   - Add tests for new fetchers and UI elements
   - Include offline fixtures for remote service tests
   - Verify performance with large datasets
   - Ensure deterministic test behavior

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - Update both user and developer documentation
   - Include examples in docstrings
   - Cross-reference related functionality
   - Maintain table of contents accuracy
